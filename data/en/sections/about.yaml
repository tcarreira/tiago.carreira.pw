# a summary about you
summary: |
  Having more than 7 years of experience with DevOps, I’m experienced with modern technologies (eg: Docker),
  proficient with Linux systems and many DevOps tools (eg: git, CI/CD, monitoring) and I’m confident developing in
  Python and Go.

  Passionate about Linux, Open Source and productivity (I love scripting and automation). No person should be a
  single point of failure - procedures should be documented and/or automated.

  I’m looking towards working with smart people, with whom I could learn and help learning; where autonomy is a
  valuable asset and improving is more important than finding who made a mistake.
