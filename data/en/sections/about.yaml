# a summary about you
summary: |
  Having 10+ years of experience with DevOps, I'm experienced with **modern technologies**
  (eg: Docker), proficient with Linux systems and many **DevOps tools** (Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC)
  and I'm a Python and Go developer.

  Passionate about Linux, **Open Source** and **productivity** (I love scripting and automation).
  No person should be a single point of failure - procedures should be documented and/or **automated**.

  I'm looking towards working with **smart people**, with whom I could learn and help learning;
  where **autonomy** is a valuable asset and **improving** is more important than finding who made a mistake.
